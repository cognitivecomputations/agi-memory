## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.local` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
POSTGRES_DB=agi_db           # Database name
POSTGRES_USER=agi_user       # Database user

    limit=10,
    threshold=0.7
)

# Text search
results = await search_memories_text(
    query="machine learning concepts",
    limit=5
)
```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
1. **working_memory**
   - Temporary storage with automatic expiry
   - Vector embeddings for similarity search
   - Priority scoring for attention mechanisms

2. **memories**
   - Permanent storage for consolidated memories
   - Links to specific memory type tables
   - Metadata tracking (creation, modification, access)

3. **memory_relationships**
   - Graph-based relationship storage
   - Bidirectional links between memories
   - Relationship type classification

### Memory Type Tables
Each specialized memory type has its own table with type-specific fields:
- episodic_memories
- semantic_memories
- procedural_memories
- strategic_memories

### Clustering Tables
- memory_clusters
- memory_cluster_members
- cluster_relationships
- cluster_activation_history

### Identity and Worldview Tables
- identity_model
- worldview_primitives
- worldview_memory_influences
- identity_memory_resonance

### Indexes and Constraints
- Vector indexes for similarity search
- Graph indexes for relationship traversal
- Temporal indexes for time-based queries

## Example Queries

### Memory Retrieval
```sql
-- Find similar memories using vector similarity
SELECT * FROM memories
WHERE embedding <-> query_embedding < threshold
ORDER BY embedding <-> query_embedding
LIMIT 10;

-- Find related memories through graph
SELECT * FROM ag_catalog.cypher('memory_graph', $$
    MATCH (m:MemoryNode)-[:RELATES_TO]->(related)
    WHERE m.id = $memory_id
    RETURN related
$$) as (related agtype);
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Vector Search**: Sub-second similarity queries on 10K+ memories
- **Memory Storage**: Supports millions of memories with proper indexing
- **Cluster Operations**: Efficient graph traversal for relationship queries
- **Maintenance**: Requires periodic consolidation and pruning

### Scaling Considerations
- Memory consolidation recommended every 4-6 hours
- Database optimization during off-peak hours
- Monitor vector index performance with large datasets

## System Maintenance

The memory system requires three key maintenance processes to function effectively:

### 1. Memory Consolidation
Short-term memories need to be consolidated into long-term storage. This process should:
- Move frequently accessed items from working memory to permanent storage
- Run periodically (recommended every 4-6 hours)
- Consider memory importance and access patterns

### 2. Memory Pruning
The system needs regular cleanup to prevent overwhelming storage:
- Archive or remove low-relevance memories
- Decay importance scores of unused memories
- Run daily or weekly, depending on system usage

### 3. Database Optimization
Regular database maintenance ensures optimal performance:
- Reindex tables for efficient vector searches
- Update statistics for query optimization
- Run during off-peak hours

### Implementation Note
These maintenance tasks can be implemented using:
- Database scheduling tools
- External task schedulers
- System-level scheduling (cron, systemd, etc.)

Choose the scheduling method that best fits your infrastructure and monitoring capabilities. Ensure proper logging and error handling for all maintenance operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs db`
- Verify extensions: Run test suite with `pytest test.py -v`

**Memory Search Performance:**
- Rebuild vector indexes if queries are slow
- Check memory_health view for system statistics
- Consider memory pruning if dataset is very large

**MCP Server Issues:**
- Verify Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
- Check database connectivity from MCP server
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

## Usage Guide

### Memory Interaction Flow

The AGI Memory System provides a layered approach to memory management, similar to human cognitive processes:

1. **Initial Memory Creation**
   - New information enters through working memory
   - System assigns initial importance scores
   - Vector embeddings are generated for similarity matching

2. **Memory Retrieval**
   - Query across multiple memory types simultaneously
   - Use similarity search for related memories
   - Access through graph relationships for connected concepts

3. **Memory Updates**
   - Automatic tracking of memory modifications
   - Importance scores adjust based on usage
   - Relationships update dynamically

4. **Memory Integration**
   - Cross-referencing between memory types
   - Automatic relationship discovery
   - Pattern recognition across memories

```mermaid
graph TD
    Input[New Information] --> WM[Working Memory]
    WM --> |Consolidation| LTM[Long-Term Memory]
    
    subgraph "Long-Term Memory"
        LTM --> EM[Episodic Memory]
        LTM --> SM[Semantic Memory]
        LTM --> PM[Procedural Memory]
        LTM --> STM[Strategic Memory]
    end
    
    Query[Query/Retrieval] --> |Vector Search| LTM
    Query --> |Graph Traversal| LTM
    
    EM ---|Relationships| SM
    SM ---|Relationships| PM
    PM ---|Relationships| STM
    
    LTM --> |Decay| Archive[Archive/Removal]
    WM --> |Cleanup| Archive
```

### Key Integration Points

- Use the MCP API for all memory operations
- Implement proper error handling for failed operations
- Monitor memory usage and system performance
- Regular backup of critical memories

### Best Practices

- Initialize working memory with reasonable size limits
- Implement rate limiting for memory operations
- Regular validation of memory consistency
- Monitor and adjust importance scoring parameters

## Important Note

This database schema is designed for a single AGI instance. Supporting multiple AGI instances would require significant schema modifications, including:

- Adding AGI instance identification to all memory tables
- Partitioning strategies for memory isolation
- Modified relationship handling for cross-AGI memory sharing
- Separate working memory spaces per AGI
- Additional access controls and memory ownership

If you need multi-AGI support, consider refactoring the schema to include tenant isolation patterns before implementation.
